A modified take on Minesweeper for Blinks. 
Created by Jordan Smith

RULES: 

Instead of trying to clear the board of mines as in traditional Minesweeper, instead you are trying to "get" to the end of the map while avoiding the mines. If you are able to reach the end of the map without hitting a mine, you win! If you do hit a mine, you lose and have to try again. 

SETUP: 
TBD

GAMEPLAY:
To make a move, simply remove any Blink from the board, and reattach it wherever you like. If the Blink turns a dim white, then the space is empty. For any yellow faces, there is a mine adjacent. 1 yellow face indicates 1 mine nearby, 2 yellow faces indicate 2 mines nearby, etc. The direction of the face has no bearing on which way the mine is. 
If the blink turns green (and subsequently all others) this means you've won! After a couple of seconds they will return to setup.
If the blink turns red (and subsequently all others) this means you've hit a mine and lost. After a couple of seconds they will return to setup. DO NOT MOVE THE BLINK THAT HIT THE MINE UNTIL AFTER THEY HAVE RETURNED TO SETUP!!!

If you place a mine out of bounds, the blink will turn off, except for one face which will point in the direction of the goal. You may not reattach a piece to an out of bounds space.
At any point you may press a connected Blink to see an indicator of which direction the end is. 
Double pressing a disconnected Blink will change it to track a mine location without exploding.
Triple pressing a Blink will reset all connected Blinks.
